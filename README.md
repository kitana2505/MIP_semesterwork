The retinal video consists of retinal images with displacement between the frames, which
results in an un-smooth video. For this reason, frames in the retinal video need to be
register to compensate for the motion between the frames. For image registration purpose,
the following three methods are used: Voxelmorph (4), The Software for the Practical
Analysis of Materials (SPAM) (7) and Autograd Image Registration Laboratory (Airlab)
(6). The results of registration (including the loss and the registered video) are compared
and stored.
